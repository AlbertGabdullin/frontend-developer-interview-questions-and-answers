JavaScript has a variety of data types that can be split into two main groups: **primitive types** and **objects**.

### Primitive Types
- **Number:** Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. For example, `42` or `3.14`.
- **String:** Used for textual data. Anything written within quotes (single, double, or backticks) is a string, like `"hello"` or `'world'`.
- **Boolean:** This type has only two values: `true` or `false`. It is often used in conditions.
- **Undefined:** Indicates that a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.
- **Null:** Represents an explicitly empty or non-existent value.
- **Symbol:** Introduced in ES6, symbols are unique and immutable, often used for unique property keys.
- **BigInt:** Used for storing numbers larger than the Number type can safely hold.

### Objects
- **Objects:** General containers for key-value pairs.
- **Arrays:** Special types of objects used to store ordered lists of values.
- **Functions:** In JavaScript, functions are also objects that can be stored in variables, passed around, and returned from other functions.
